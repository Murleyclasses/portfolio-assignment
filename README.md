# Portfolio Assignment

Create a site on Github pages that would potentially serve as a personal portfolio site to show to prospective employers. It should include at least four (4) html pages, including:
* Splash page
* Resume - Must be formatted in HTML/CSS (no PDFs or Word docs)
* Projects - At least six examples of work you have done in your career at EIU 
* Contact Info/Social Media

#### Details:
* Portfolio pages must use only CSS for fonts, color and positioning.
* Navigation must use HTML/CSS.
* GIFs or JPGs may be used, but not in place of body text. You may create a logo or nameplate that is a GIF or JPG.
* You may use GIFs or JPGs as backgrounds, including button backgrounds.
* While you may start with a template from someone else, your web site should be significantly your own. If you do use a template as a starting point, you must cite the source of the template when you turn in the project and provide a link back to the template.

When you have completed the project, you will need to send a pull request to this document for me to review your site/code.
